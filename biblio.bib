abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of autofocusing for tissue microscopy. We first investigate the suitability of several criterion functions for the evaluation of image sharpness. Since tissue sections are invariably stained, we also discuss the selection of the colour component on which autofocusing will be performed. In tissue microscopy, where a section generally comprises multiple layers, it is often not possible to obtain an image that is well focused over the field of view because of the limited depth of field of the objective. We describe focus enhancement algorithms, closely related to the autofocus system, which may be employed to obtain an entirely sharp image.}

abstract = {Abstract Whole slide imaging (WSI) has moved digital pathology closer to diagnostic practice in recent years. Due to the inherent tissue topography variability, accurate autofocusing remains a critical challenge for WSI and automated microscopy systems. The traditional focus map surveying method is limited in its ability to acquire a high degree of focus points while still maintaining high throughput. Real-time approaches decouple image acquisition from focusing, thus allowing for rapid scanning while maintaining continuous accurate focus. This work reviews the traditional focus map approach and discusses the choice of focus measure for focal plane determination. It also discusses various real-time autofocusing approaches including reflective-based triangulation, confocal pinhole detection, low-coherence interferometry, tilted sensor approach, independent dual sensor scanning, beam splitter array, phase detection, dual-LED illumination and deep-learning approaches. The technical concepts, merits and limitations of these methods are explained and compared to those of a traditional WSI system. This review may provide new insights for the development of high-throughput automated microscopy imaging systems that can be made broadly available and utilizable without loss of capacity.},
