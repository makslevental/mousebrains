abstract = "Flame aerosol technology is used for large-scale manufacture of ceramic commodities such as pigmentary titania, fumed silica and alumina. In addition, the introduction of this technology to the manufacture of optical fibers and its potential for cheap synthesis of ultrafine particles (e.g. nanoparticles) has renewed the research interest for better understanding of flame aerosol reactors. Here, after an overview of the history of this technology, the current state of knowledge on the role of flame process variables (additives, mixing etc.) on the characteristics of product powders is summarized in a tutorial fashion. The fundamentals of particle formation and growth are highlighted by summarizing the dynamics of spherical particles that are reasonably well understood. The latest advances on the theory of aggregate particle dynamics that are typically encountered in flame synthesis of powders are presented. Specific applications in the manufacture of fumed silica, pigmentary titania, alumina, and other oxide and non-oxide ceramic powders are reviewed. Finally, research needs are highlighted by pointing out the most promising areas for advancing the field with emphasis on instrumentation and need for detailed simulators of the process accounting for the concurrent chemistry, transport and aggregate particle dynamics. With major recent advances in diagnostics and understanding in both combustion and aerosol science and engineering, this field is ready for a new leap forward."

abstract = "In this paper a study was made of the conditions of formation and properties of Al2O3 aerosol obtained by oxidation of aluminium acetylacetonate ultrasonically sprayed into a hydrocarbon-oxygen flame. Spherical particles with diameters as small as 30 Å were obtained at sprayer frequency ν = 1 MHz as a result of rapid combustion. Temperature measurements and investigation of the flame emission spectrum as well as of the shape and size of particles suggest that liquid Al2O3 droplets are formed from the gaseous phase next to be crystallized from the
liquid phase. Comparison of the results concerning Al2O3 formation in H2 + O2 flame and in the hydrocarbon-oxygen flame leads to the suggestion that the γ-Al2O3 phase is formed if synthesis and crystallization occurs in the presence of the H2O and/or OH and the liquid particles are rapidly cooled. The following scheme of the aerosol formation mechanism is proposed: [Al2O3]L. OHads denotes Al2O3 particle with chemisorbed OH."
